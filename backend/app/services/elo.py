ELO Calculation Module

This module provides functions to calculate team ELO, win probabilities, K factors, and ELO changes.

It implements a "pool" system with a correction factor to ensure that the total ELO points in the system remain
constant after each match, even when using variable K-factors. This prevents ELO inflation or deflation over time.

Example of pool system correction:
If Player A (ELO 1100, K=100) beats Player B (ELO 1900, K=24):
- Initial calculated change for A: +80 ELO
- Initial calculated change for B: -19 ELO
- Sum of changes: +61 ELO (inflation)

To correct this, the system will distribute a total of -61 ELO points back to the players, proportional to their K-factors:
- Total K-factor: 100 + 24 = 124
- Correction factor per K: -61 / 124 â‰ˆ -0.49
- Corrected change for A: 80 + (100 * -0.49) = 80 - 49 = +31 ELO
- Corrected change for B: -19 + (24 * -0.49) = -19 - 12 = -31 ELO
- New sum of changes: +31 + (-31) = 0 ELO (zero-sum maintained)
